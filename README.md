# PiPlug
Python code for use with a Pi and a 4 channel relay module

Hardware required:
1 x Raspberry Pi (tested with a 3B but probably any would work)
2 x 5v 4 channel relay module to control 4 230v devices
1 x Real time clock device if no internet time

Configuration:
Change / add timings to the on and off lists, the script will 
check there are no irregularities

Enjoy
